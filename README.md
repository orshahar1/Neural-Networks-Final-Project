# Neural Networks Final Project

This repository contains the final project for the Neural Networks course at Bar-Ilan University. The project focuses on classifying two types of neurons (pyramidal and aspiny) based on their electrical responses, using advanced machine learning techniques and data analysis.

## Project Overview

### Objective
- Classify pyramidal and aspiny neurons using their electrical signal data.
- Evaluate model performance based on accuracy and loss metrics.
- Explore the potential of neural networks for biological data classification.

### Methods
- Data preprocessing, including normalization and feature selection.
- Model implementation using neural network architecture.
- Optimization using backpropagation and gradient descent.
- Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, and Loss Function.
